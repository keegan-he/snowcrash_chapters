				1. </br>The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He's got esprit up to here.
				Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night. His uniform is black as
				activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber
				weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a
				freshly napalmed forest, Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like
				gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books. When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun.
				The Dcliverator never deals in cash, but someone might come after him anyway-might want his car, or his
				cargo. The gun is tiny, acm-

				styled, lightweight, the kind of gun a fashion designer would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at
				five times the velocity of an SR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into
				the cigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.
				The Deiverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once in Gila Highlands. Some
				punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted themselves a delivery, and they didn't want to pay
				for it. Thought they would impress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deiverator took out his gun,
				centered its laser doohickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it. The recoil was immense, as
				though the weapon had blown up in his hand. The middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of
				burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding this bat
				handle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his face. Didn't get nothing but trouble
				from the Deiverator.
				Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and relied, instead, on a matched
				set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands
				weren't afraid of the gun, so the Dcliverator was forced to use it. But swords need no demonstrations.
				The Deliverator's car has enough potential energy packed into its batteries to fire a pound of bacon
				into the Asteroid Belt. Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb beater, the Deliverator's car unloads that power
				through gaping, gleaming, polished sphincters. When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.
				You want to talk contact patches? Your car's tires have tiny contact patches, talk to the asphalt in
				four places the size of your tongue. The Deiverator's car has big sticky tires with contact patches the
				size of a fat lady's thighs. The Deliverator is in touch with the road, starts like a bad day, stops on
				a peseta.
				Why is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a roll model. This is America.
				People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that? Because they have a right
				to. And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them. As a result, this country has one of
				the worst economies in the world. When it gets down to it-talking trade balances here-once we've
				brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they're making
